# hackerman14.github.io

The official website of the bot hackerman14!

## Versions

All versions of the website!

**v1**: Colorlib Template, didn't look too nice since I'd only edited the template.

**v2**: Mobirise, it looked way better than the original ones since it was edited through a website builder.

**v3**: Brizy, basically just updated some of the components for the website and it's also edited through a website builder.

## Tutorials

Boring tutorials on how to use the website builders

### Mobirise

To begin, go to [Mobirise](https://mobirise.com) and download the website builder.

Execute the app, and you are given a template (just edit it or add some element, the app should guide you how)

### Brizy

I used the pro version of it so it gives me more benefit on building the website.

To begin, sign up for [Brizy](https://brizy.io) and then go to [Brizy Cloud](https://brizy.cloud) to start your journey.

After done editing your own website, you can select to publish to its subdomain or download the file and upload to your own web hosting.
